Transmitters problem - graph colouring algorithm.

This application is my answer to a simple problem:

> There is a city of radius R with N transmitters in it that have range (radius) of T each. If two or more transmitters overlap in their ranges they need to broadcast in different frequency. What is the smallest number of frequencies for which all transmitters can broadcast without problems?
